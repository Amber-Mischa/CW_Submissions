//PART ONE: MODULUS
//What would each of the following 1-6 lines including the modulo operator cause to be printed?
     System.out.println(14 % 13);

//PART TWO: COMPOUND OPERATORS AND SHORTCUTS (credits to runestone.academy)

    int x = 0;
    int y = 1;
    int z = 2;
    x--; // x followed by the double minus sign
    y++;
    z+=y;
//After the above code runs, what are x, y, and z equal to?
 /* x = -1
  * y = 2
  * z = 4
 */

    int a = 3;
    int b = 5;
    int c = 2;
    a = c * 2;
    b = b / 2;
    c++;
//After the above code runs, what are a, b, and c equal to?
 /* a = 4
  * b = 2
  * c = 3
 */

//PART THREE: CASTING

    int total = 5 + 7 + 2;
    (double) (total / 3); //Option A
    total / 3; //Option B
    (double) total / 3; //Option C

//Which of the above options correctly computes the average of total? Why do the other options not work?
/* Option C works.
 * Option B doesn't work because it will just give an int since it isn't casted as an double. 
 * Option A doesn't work becuase it will solve what is in parentheses first and then cast it as a double.
